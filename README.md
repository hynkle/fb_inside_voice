# FB Inside Voice

This is a Google Chrome browser extension that affects Facebook, making those large-text,
color- and gradient-background posts look like a normal post: normal font size,
with black text on a white background.

## Installation

You can find it [right over here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fb-inside-voice/lffdmpbongdjdaoohcabdbgpdcfmobgk?hl=en-US).
